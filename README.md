# Noah Dela Rosa's Website

## Development Process and Insight

This is a website where I talk about some of my other projects, and also my resume. There
are two pages, one is the main home page, where I give a description of myself, and give
a greater amount of insight on some the projects that I listed in my resume. The other page
is the resume, which is my current resume marked-up along with some inclusions of hyperlinks
to my profiles on other sites. On the top right, there is also a button to a pdf view of the
resume.

For the development process order, I initially marked-up and styled the resume page because 
the main format was already determined by the original resume. Past that point however, 
I had some trouble determining where to go next. I knew that the home page was supposed to 
give a more detailed description of myself and my projects, but I was trying to figure out
the best format for it. I stuck with the most straightforward approach: to specify an
elevator-pitch style description for each of the main projects, in a document-like format.

Overall I think that the general website is styled decently with with consistent elements,
and a clean, easy-to-understand format. However some of the styling still has some issues,
specifically with scaling on different sized screens. The two column elements have the text
overlap on less wide screens, as well as the top navigation bar does not always fully 
cover all of the whitespace close to the edges. The pdf link also has some strange behavior
of changing height when the viewport width is less wide.

The styling with css was a little difficult, as the majority of the process involved 
selecting a box attribute to modify, putting a somewhat arbitrary value, and then checking 
if that value looks correct. I am unsure if there is a better process to development, but 
now I have a greater insight to the appeal to WYSIWYG website development.

Another drawback I see is that the website seems a bit basic, with the lack of animations, 
or the little variation in the representations, like walls of text instead of pictures. 
Areas where I feel I would like to focus on improving are including some JavaScript in 
meaningful ways to make the site more dynamic, as well as include some better
representations for my projects, like maybe a gif of the program running, or even embed a 
demo of the project itself. I also have some experience using web-gl, and would like to
include a canvas element to further add more interactivity. I do think however, that the 
current sate of the site is a good foundation to add more features.
