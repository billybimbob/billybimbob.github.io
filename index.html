                Am currently a Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology.
                I enjoy making fun projects, and am always willing to learn new ideas, as well 
                as helping teach others. I have been a teaching assistant for over two year for 
                various classes like data structures and object-oriented programming, and also 
                enjoy collaborating with others. Mostly I am proficient with Java and Python, 
                but am still experienced with JavaScript, C, and Haskell.

                Here are some personal projects that I have been working on. Most of them are
                still a work in progress, will all the code found on 
                <a href="https://github.com/billybimbob">my github</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/billybimbob/Text-Fighter">Text-based Role-playing Fighter</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This one is a turned-based text role-playing text fighter, inspired by mechanics from Pokemon
                and World of Warcraft. Players can play as one of multiple classes, and take on various monsters.
                Each class has a different playstyle, like the melee-focused warrior, the spell-casting mage, 
                disruption-based priest, or the versatile shapeshifter. Other mechanics include items like potions,
                armor and weapons to help add some more variations. The program outputs to the console, but I have 
                intentions to create a better interface, as well as adding exploration mechanics to make this
                game a more full-fledged rpg.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/billybimbob/CS100-Checkers">Checkers Tournament</a></h3>
            <p>
                This project was initially made to be used as a lab exercise to students in order to apply
                game theory concepts in a programming context. Each student implements a checkers board
                analyzer, which is then used to run students in a round-robin style checkers tournament.
                Each checkers match takes two players, where each move is determined by using a greedy search
                to predict the upcoming turns based on the students' board analyzers. All of the output is 
                currently in a console representation. I plan to change it to a more interactive GUI in the
                future.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/billybimbob/MusicIdentifier">Music Identifier</a></h3>
            <p>
                Based on an implementation I found online, this program mimics the baseline functionality
                of the <a href="https://www.shazam.com/">Shazam</a> music discovery app. The program listens
                to an audio sample, breaks it down into key frequency points using a Discrete Fourier 
                transformation, and matches those points against preexisting values. To work properly, songs 
                need to be parsed and stored before they can be identified. The main issue is that I still 
                have to find a way to store the parsed values in a fast and space efficient manner. The initial 
                parse method can also be improved, as only local audio files currently work.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/billybimbob/Game-Of-Life">Game of Life</a></h3>
            <p>
                Look at that, another game. This one is more in the sense that it is a cellular simulation,
                and less of an interactive game. The behavior implements the rules of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> in 
                Python, along with having some simple starting patterns like the glider, glider gun, and toad.
                Currently the application outputs to either the console or the curses terminal, but I plan to 
                add an actual GUI interface and better user input to allow for custom patterns.

                When I am not focusing on school or projects, I enjoy playing video games, playing
                the piano, and tennis. But most important of all, I enjoy spending time with my friends
                and my family.
